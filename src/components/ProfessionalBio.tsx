            I co-founded Embr Labs in 2014 as a senior at MIT and am currently
            Chief Revenue Officer after eleven years as COO. I helped create the
            wearable thermal wellness category with Embr Wave, the first
            personal thermostat that lets people cool down or warm up at the
            touch of a button.

            Over the past twelve years, I&apos;ve scaled from lab prototypes to
            market leader: $50M+ in lifetime revenue, 200k+ customers across
            100+ countries, 250k+ units shipped, 20 utility patents, and $66M in
            venture financing. I also led the shift from one-time hardware sales
            to a subscription model, taking Embrship hardware subscription from
            $0 to a $4M ARR run rate in eight months.
