            I co-founded Embr Labs in 2014 as a senior at MIT and am currently Chief Revenue
            Officer after eleven years as COO. I helped create the wearable thermal wellness
            category with Embr Wave, the first personal thermostat that lets people cool down
            or warm up at the touch of a button.
          </p>

          <p>
            Over the past twelve years, I&apos;ve scaled from lab prototypes to market leader:
            $50M+ in lifetime revenue, 200k+ customers across 100+ countries, 250k+ units
            shipped, 20 utility patents, and $66M in venture financing. I also led the shift
            from one-time hardware sales to a subscription model, taking Embrship hardware
            subscription from $0 to a $4M ARR run rate in eight months.
          </p>

            Recognition includes Forbes 30 Under 30, TIME Best Inventions, the National Sleep
            Foundation&apos;s SleepTech Award, and Oprah&apos;s Menopause Award.
          </p>

            As a national champion wrestler and three-year captain at MIT, I bring a coach&apos;s
            mindset and a P&L-first approach to building teams. I am active in the startup
            ecosystem advising founders and PE/VC-backed companies, speaking at conferences,
            and lecturing at universities on category creation, hardware-software integration,
            subscription design, and go-to-market execution, and I speak on these topics regularly.
