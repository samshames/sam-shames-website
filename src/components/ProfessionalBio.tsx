              I co-founded Embr Labs in 2014 and am currently Chief Revenue
              Officer after 11 years as COO. I helped create the wearable
              thermal wellness category with Embr Wave, the first personal
              thermostat that cools or warms you at the touch of a button.
            </p>

            <p>
              Over the past twelve years, I&apos;ve helped to scale Embr Labs
              from an MIT prototyping competition to a market leader: $50M+ in
              lifetime revenue, 200k+ customers across 100+ countries, 250k+
              units shipped, 21 utility patents, and $60M+ in venture financing.
              I also led the shift from one-time sales to a subscription model,
              taking the Embrship hardware subscription from $0 to a $4M ARR run
              rate in eight months.
